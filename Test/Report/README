The blocks in this directory are to be used in preparing your lab report.
For each block, you need to report the number of simulated cycles that 
it takes to run the block, on both the original code and the transformed
code produced by you scheduler.

Be sure to verify that the transformed code produces the same output as
the original code.  We will check.
