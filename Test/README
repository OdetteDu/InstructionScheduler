Three directories:

Contributed -- blocks contributed by prior generations of 412 students

ReportBlocks -- blocks for your lab report.  You must report the number of 
                simulated cycles for these blocks, their original form and
 		after your scheduler has run.

TestBlocks -- blocks intended to help you test your scheduler

A careful student will, of course, try all of them.
